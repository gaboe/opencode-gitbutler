# Runtime Artifact Policy for Analysis Loop
# This directory contains ephemeral analysis artifacts and checkpoints.
# Only tracked files (report.md, report-template.md) are committed.

# Checkpoint patches - one per iteration, used for recovery
checkpoint-*.patch

# Patch ledger - tracks all patches applied across iterations
patch-ledger.json

# Iteration logs and temporary analysis outputs
*.log
*.tmp

# Keep tracked files (do not ignore):
# - report.md (final analysis report)
# - report-template.md (template for report generation)
